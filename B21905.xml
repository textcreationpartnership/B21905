            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>And we have alwayes desired from our hearts and soules,
<pb facs="tcp:204937:3"/> manifested in our actions and proceedings▪ and in severall humble Petitions and Remonstrances to His Majesty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed our Loyalty, and Obedience to his Crowne, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse and resolution to defend His person, and support His estate with our lives and fortunes, to the uttermost of our power.</p>
            <p>That we have beene willing to passe by not onely those injuries, ignominies, slanders and false accusations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we have beene privately oppressed and grieved, but likewise many publique incroachments and high usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the prejudice of Religion and Liberty, divers bloudy Trayterous and cruell practises and designes for the utter ruine and destruction of the Church and State, so as we might for the time to come have beene secured from that wicked and mallignant party, those pernicious and Trayterous Councells, who have beene the authors and fomentors of the former mischiefes and present calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which have and still doe distemper this Church and State.</p>
            <p>That for the same purpose, and for the avoyding of bloud we directed the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> Lord General by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe or others, in some safe and honorable way to cause to be delivered an humble Petition, wherein we do desire nothing from His Majesty, but that he would returne in peace to His Parliament, and by their faithfull Councell and advise compose the distempers and confusions abounding in His Kingdomes, as he is bound to do; we therein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing in the sight of Almighty God, which is the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Obligation and assurance that any Christian, and the most solemn publique Faith, which any such State as a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament can give, that we would receive Him with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yeeld Him all true Obedience and subjection, and faithfully endeavour to defend His Person and estate, from all danger, and to the uttermost of our power, to establish
<pb facs="tcp:204937:3"/> to Him and to His people, all the blessings of a glorious and happy Raigne, as it is more largely exprest in that Petition.</p>
            <p>For the delivery of which Petition his Excellency hath twice sent unto the King, humbly desiring a safe conduct for those who should be imployed therein, but His Majesty refused to give any such safe conduct, or to receive this humble and dutifull Petition by any addresse from the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> saying that if Justice had beene done the Gentleman which brought the second message could not expect his liberty.</p>
            <p>By all which and many other evidences &amp; inducements, we are fully convinc'd in our judgements and beliefe, that the Kings Councells, and Resolutions are so engaged to the popish party, for the suppression and extirpation of the true Religion, that all hopes of peace and protection are excluded, and that it is fully intended to give satisfaction to the <hi>Papists</hi> by alteration of Religion, and to the Cavaleers and other Souldiers, by exposing the wealth of the good Subjects, especially of this City of <hi>London</hi> to be sackt plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and spoild by them.</p>
            <p>That for the better effecting hereof, great numbers of <hi>Papists</hi> have in shew conformed themselves to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion by comming to the Church, receiving the Sacrament, and taking the Oathes of allegiance, and supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy which some of their owne Priests have encouraged them to do, by maintaining that they might do all those things, and yet continue good Catholiques, under which cover His Majesty did at first begin to strengthen himselfe, those of that Religion being weake, and unable to endure the envy and discontent which the arming of the <hi>Papists</hi> would procure in the Kingdome, and therefore endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keepe off all jealousies and suspitions by many feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Oaths and Imprecations, concerning his purpose of
<pb facs="tcp:204937:4"/> maintaining the Protestant Religion and the Lawes of the Kingdome, causing some profest <hi>Papists</hi> to be discharged out of his Army, and none to be received that would not endure the test of comming to Church, receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and taking the Oathes.</p>
            <p>That His Majesty being now growne stronger, and able as he conceives to make good His owne ends by Armes, His Confidence in the <hi>Papists</hi> doth more clearly appeare; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons imprison'd for Priests and Jesuits have beene released out of the goale of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> profest <hi>Papists</hi> have been invited to rise and take up Armes, Commissions under His Majesties authority have beene granted to many of them for places of command in this War, with power to raise men, and great numbers have beene raised by them, and they daily increase, as namely to sir <hi>Nicholas Thornton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Barronet, Sir <hi>Edward Widdington,</hi> Sir <hi>William Riddell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith of Ash,</hi> Master <hi>George Wray,</hi> Master <hi>Edward Grey</hi> of <hi>Morpeth-Castle,</hi> Master <hi>Launcelot Errington of Dento,</hi> Master <hi>Launcelot Holtby</hi> all of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Bishoprick of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>New castle,</hi> to Master <hi>Clifton,</hi> Master <hi>William Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sir <hi>VVillam Gerrard</hi> Barronet, Sir <hi>Cicill Trafford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Anderson</hi> of <hi>Lostock</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and divers forces are raised and paid by the Earle of <hi>VVorcester</hi> and his sonne the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> and as we are informed by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse messenger sent from those parts, The said L. <hi>Herbert,</hi> a notorious Papist is made Generall of all South <hi>Wales;</hi> and we are further informed out of <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> by divers persons of great worth and quality, that those that raise Forces in those parts for his Majesty doarme and imploy papists, and use their advise in their consultations, All which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the solemn Oathes, Protestations, and Execrations, whereby his Majesty bound himself to maintain the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, and the lawes of the Land, By which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to get a confidence in the people of his good
<pb facs="tcp:204937:4"/> intentions, which how well it is answered we leave the world to judge.</p>
            <p>That Sir <hi>I. Hinderson,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Cokram</hi> men of ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, both for religion and honesty, are sent to <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi> as we are credibly informed, to raise forces there, and to bring them to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and to joyn with the Earle of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and the Army of Papists which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to raise there; And that divers endeavours have been used in other forraine parts, to bring in strange forces into the Kingdom; That the King hath received about him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers papists of <hi>Ireland,</hi> some of which are indited of high treason for their rebellion there, notoriously known to have been in actuall rebellion; as namely, the Lord <hi>Taffe,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Dungane,</hi> proclaimed a Rebel, Collonel <hi>Fitzwilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</hi> Dr. <hi>Meara</hi> indited for the rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> and fled for the same, and yet appointed Phisition to Prince <hi>Rupert;</hi> And that his Majesty hath sent for the petition of the Irish Rebels which the Justices had stopt, with evident expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of favour to them, whereby that Kingdom is like to become an unfit habitation of any Protestants, and a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of War and treason against this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That divers English Traytors, actors in the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes against the Kingdome and Parliament, are chiefe counsellors and actors in this unnaturall warre against his subjects, as the Lord <hi>Digby, Oneale, Wilmot, Pollard, Ashburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>That we have been likewise credibly informed that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Jesuits and Priests in forraigne parts make great colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of money for reliefe of the papists in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the furthering of his Majesties designes here against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that by them and some others fled out of this Kingdom for treason, great means are made to take up the differences betwixt some Princes of the Roman religion, that so they might unite their strength for the extirpation of the Protestant Religion, wherein principally this Kingdom
<pb facs="tcp:204937:5"/> and the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> are concerned, as making the greatest body of the reformed Religion in Christendome, and best able to defend themselves, and succour other Churches.</p>
            <p>For all which reasons we are resolved to enter into a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oath and covenant with God, to give up our selves, our lives, and fortunes into his hands; And that we will to the utmost of our power and judgement maintain his truth, and conform our selves to his wil, that we wil defend this cause with the hazzard of our lives against the Kings army, and against all that shal joyn with them in prosecution of this wicked designe, according to the form to be agreed upon by both Houses of Parliament, to be subscribed by our hands. And that we wil for the same ends associate our selves, and unite with all the wel affected in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and other parts of his Majesties Dominions.</p>
            <p>That we expect our brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to the act of Pacification, whereby the two Kingdomes are mutually bound to suppresse all debates and differences to the disturbance of the publike peace, That they will help and assist us in defence of this cause; which if the Popish party prevaile, must needs either involve them in that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Religion which wil be made here, or engage them in a war against this Kingdome, to defend their own Religion and liberty. And we doubt not but the God of truth, and the great protector of his people will assist and enable us in this our just defence, to restraine the malice and fury of those that seek our ruine, and to secure the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, estates, and liberties of all that joyn with us; And to procure and establish the safety of religion, and fruition of our lawes and liberties, in this and all other his Majesties Dominions, which we do here again professe before the everliving God, to be the chiefe end of all our Counsels and resolutions, without any intention or desire to hurt or injure his Majesty, either in his person or just Power.</p>
